# Asdf

Used for a bunch of CLI tools that are useful during local development and are
automatically triggered by pre-commit locally and within the CI/CD pipeline.

It's recommened to have this installed locally, but it is not necessary. What's
more important is to have the tools installed listed in
[`../.tool-versions`](../.tool-versions), as these tools are used in the
CI/CD pipelines.

Configured via [`../.tool-versions`](../.tool-versions).
